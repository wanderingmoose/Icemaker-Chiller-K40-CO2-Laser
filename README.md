# Icemaker-Chiller-K40-CO2-Laser

Simple system for chilling cooling fluid for the K40 CO2 Laser tube.
I found sites on the internet about chilling the K40 laser with a Ice maker. I looked and did a little math and it should be work.
So I bought one at the local Walmart for $98.00 CND and started my test.
I tried with stock with no modes, just pushing the return tube up into the ice forming tray and and the pump into water tank.
IT WORKED. And it was enough of a test to move forward with modding the Ice Maker. 
I used a Cheap temperature controller from China, disabled the circuit board and just let the controller handle turning on and off the compressor
to try and keep the water temperature return between 15-20 degrees C.

By the pictures you can find here under Pictures, you will see what the unit looks like. I ran this way for over a year while I tinkered with 
a Arduino system to controll the Chiller, Water Flow, Door Alarms and laser lockout.
I pretty much had the code written, but wanted a bigger display for this system.
